As Karl-Oskar in [Utvandrarna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emigrants_(novel_series)) took his family over the vast Ocean, `Karl-Oskar` will help you over the sea of database changes. With [DbUp](https://github.com/DbUp/DbUp) as the Transantlantic crossing vessel, `Karl-Oskar` will set sails and help you to the other shore.
